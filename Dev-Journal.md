## Dev Journal & Progress

- 6/28/2023 - I already have tested this tool on smaller files which work very
well however tools like `selectolax` and `pyimgui's core.pyx` files need some work to accomplish. There's still 
a few more nodes left that need attention especially when extracing the details from which is why I have currently made stubfiles for cython's 
files such as typedefines. pxd files are still needing support of thier own as carrying class definitions in with and normal python classes still
need some work especially subclasses. Currently pyduktape2's stubfile when generating still needs a few attentions to details however no typehints were able to be carried which is something that might have to be fixed in future versions of this compiler before I merge it to cython. 
Allow me to share with all of you some examples of what this tool can currently do...
```cython
# test.pyx
#cython:language_level=3
cimport cython 


cdef class TestClass:
    cdef:
        readonly str test
        readonly Py_ssize_t size


cdef public enum flag:
    red = 0
    yellow = 1
    blue = 2 
```
Note that the top and where I talk about enums is manually added as well as the output in comments...
```python
# -- test.pyi --
# Python stub file generated by Cython 0.29.35 And CyStub.py

from typing import Any, Generator

class TestClass:
    test: str
    size: int
    pass

# enums have C behavrios which is why they cannot be carried as python enums, enums must be public to be passed on through...
# -- enum flag --
red = 0
yellow = 1
blue = 2
```
