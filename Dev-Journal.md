## Dev Journal & Progress

- 6/28/2023 - I already have tested this tool on smaller files which work very
well however tools like `selectolax` and `pyimgui's core.pyx` files need some work to accomplish. There's still 
a few more nodes left that need attention especially when extracing the details from which is why I have currently made stubfiles for cython's 
files such as typedefines. pxd files are still needing support of thier own as carrying class definitions in with and normal python classes still
need some work especially subclasses.
