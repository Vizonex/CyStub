## Dev Journal & Progress

- 6/28/2023 - I already have tested this tool on smaller files which work very
well however tools like `selectolax` and `pyimgui's core.pyx` files need some work to accomplish. There's still 
a few more nodes left that need attention especially when extracing the details from which is why I have currently made stubfiles for cython's 
files such as typedefines. pxd files are still needing support of thier own as carrying class definitions in with and normal python classes still
need some work especially subclasses. Currently pyduktape2's stubfile when generating still needs a few attentions to details however no typehints were able to be carried which is something that might have to be fixed in future versions of this compiler before I merge it to cython. 
Allow me to share with all of you some examples of what this tool can currently do...
```cython
# test.pyx
#cython:language_level=3
cimport cython 


cdef class TestClass:
    cdef:
        readonly str test
        readonly Py_ssize_t size


cdef public enum flag:
    red = 0
    yellow = 1
    blue = 2 
```
Note that the top and where I talk about enums is manually added as well as the output in comments...
```python
# -- test.pyi --
# Python stub file generated by Cython 0.29.35 And CyStub.py

from typing import Any, Generator

class TestClass:
    test: str
    size: int
    pass

# enums have C behavrios which is why they cannot be carried as python enums, enums must be public to be passed on through...
# -- enum flag --
red = 0
yellow = 1
blue = 2
```

I have already generated stubfiles for some of cython's nodes in order to help me out since I'm working with vs code and I wanted to be sure that what I end up doing is absolutely correct.

Now that I come to think of it . It might not be a bad idea to have the tool scan for classes and 
parts of functions before-hand as a two step method rather than just one, like an external Cython TreeVisitor for visiting different varibale Types, C structures and Python Classes beforehand use so that way when it's time to write down all the definitions. They will more likely be avalible when it's time to write them all down... 

I'll also try to make a smarter system so that it's not scanning one entirely one file so that way all imported modules and including all `.pxi` `.py` `.pyx` and `.pxd` and all external definitions in files are also being accounted for like a roll-call/head-count ... 

Once the system works, I'll then start optimizing. The other thing I thought about was using quotes when the object hasn't appeared or been declared yet after the object has been declared. This may require a new-class maybe that can be a new argument of it's own.

This might require a rewrite of what I've done so far but I'll upload another file before called VariableCatcher or VariableRegistry unlike the one already made. Which aims to read nodes for all of the following

- ctypedef Definitions so that they can be translated quicker...
- cdef classes and python classes so they can be annoted when quotes are not nessesary...
- I'll be sure regristry is fast by using a dictionary for help this will make especially larger files easier to load. This however might just be an extra flag so that systems that don't have a whole lot of ram avalible can ignore this feature if needed.

Here's a visual representation of exactly what I'm reffering to:
```python
# -- example.pyi --

# object "A" Must be quoted because it hasn't been declared yet...
def before(a:"A") -> int:...

# object "A" is now being declared...
class A:
    def __init__(self) -> None:...
    # this is just an example of a stub ouput so 
    # I'm not going to go super deep into this but you get the idea...
    def some_function(self) -> str:...

# object "A" has already been declared so no more quotes are needed to be wrapped around it... 
def after(a:A) -> A:...

```
Please note that not everything can be catched by this program but I hope that developers who use typehints in cython and have to in C can be rewarded this way with this library not just with regualr annotations but also C annotations such as what I have visually given down below...

```cython

cpdef str faster_utf8(bytes raw_data, Py_ssize_t size = 0):
    # Some data will be written inside of here that may have a faster algorythm for 
    # encoding utf-8 strings than what even CPython has written for itself...
    # a perfect example of utf-8 string encoding can be found in the cython parts of aiohttp
    # see: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/master/aiohttp/_http_writer.pyx
    ...
```

```python
def faster_utf8(raw_data : bytes, size:int = 0) -> str:...
```

I'll go into more details about this when I have the chance to resume it. In the meantime I'll work on the pre-variable-visitor build to work more on this concept of capturing variables before writing...
